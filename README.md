## About
This project uses the California Housing dataset got from Kaggle to train and test a regression model for predicting housing prices. The median house value is taken as the dependent variable and the rest of the features used to predict it are median income, population, bedroon ratio, rooms per household, among others.

## Libraries
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
- Download the dataset from Kaggle
- Load the dataset into Notebook environment
- Explore the general structure of the dataset
- Clean and transform the data into desired form
- Split the dataset into two parts; train and test
- Train the model on 80% of the data and test it on the remaining 20%
- Scale the model
- Check the regression score of the model to see how well it predicts the housing prices.
